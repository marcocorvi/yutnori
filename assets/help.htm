<h3> Y U T   N O R I </h3>

Yut Nori is a traditinal korean game.<br>
This is an abridged version of the game.<br>
Use "Back" button to quit Yutnori.<br><p>

There are two ways to play: 
<ol>
<li><a href="#android">you play against Android</a>.</li> 
<li><a href="#friend">you play against your friend</a>.</li>
</ol><p>

<h4>THE RULES OF YUT NORI</h4>

There are two players.<br>
Each player has four pawns (mal).<br>
The Yut Nori board has 29 stations.<br>
At the beginning all the pawns are at the bottom left.<br>
You move the pawns on the board starting from the start station, indicated by the black L-arrow, and go around the board counterclockwise, until they pass beyond the fourth corner (and are placed in the "home" at the bottom right).<br>
If a pawns stops at a corner at the next move you can decide to move it through the shortcut diagonal.<br><p>

Therefore there are five routes to go through the board.<br>

<br><p>

To move the pawn the players throw the Yut Nori sticks in turn.<br>
They move the pawns by the score they get:<br>
<ul>
<li>one stick up (do): move by one step</li>
<li>two sticks up (gae): move by two steps</li>
<li>three sticks up (geol): move by three steps</li>
<li>four sticks up (yut): move by four steps</li>
<li>all sticks down (mo): move by five steps</li>
</ul>
When a player scores "yut" (4) or "mo" (5) he gets another throw.  Therefore there is no limit to the number of scores a player can get before he moves. The scores can be played separatedly, each given to a pawn, but a score cannot be split among two pawns.<br><p>

If a pawn lands on a station occupied by the other players' pawns these are sent back to the initial cell, and the player gets another throw of the sticks.<br><p>

If a pawn lands on a station occupied by another pawn of the same player, the pawns form a group and travel together from that point on.  [Note: in the traditional Yut Nori the player can decide whether to form a group or not].<br><p>

The game is won by the player who completes the board course with all the four pawns first.<br><p>


<a name="android"><h4>PLAYING WITH ANDROID</h4></a>
When you open Yutnori, a menu with 3 items appears.
You choose "Play against Android".
Android' pawns are RED.
Your pawns are BLUE, and you start first.<br><p>

When it is your turn to throw the sticks a yut picture appears at the bottom and "THROW" is displayed in the title. Tap on the yut picture to throw the sticks.
The outcome is shown above the board.<br><p>

After you have thrown the sticks, the title becomes "MOVE". To move a pown (or a group of powns) tap on the pown you want to move (or on the powns at to bottom left). They are highlighted with a blue background. Then tap on the station you want to move it to. To move it to the "home" station tap at the bottom right.<br><p>

When it is Android turn, the title becomes red and it shows "WAIT".<br><p>

When the game is over the title displays the winner and a dialog tells you who won.<br><p>


<a name="friend"><h4>PLAYING AGAINST YOUR FRIEND</h4></a>

You and your friend must have your Androids paired on bluetooth.<br><p>

Open your Yutnoris.<br>
When the menu with 3 items appears, one of you choose "Wait for a friend's
Yutnori request" and wait. The other have to choose "Ask a friend to play together".<br>
When the list of paired devices appears, he selects the friend's device, and taps "Attach". Android sends to the friend a message "<i>...</i> wants to play with you", where <i>...</i> is the name of the Android that asked the connection.<br>
The friend selects "Accept". Android sends messages to both of you "Connected to <i>...</i>. Let's decide who starts. Your color is RED/BLUE". You select "OK".<br><p>

To decide who starts, you and your friend throw the yuts in turns (when the yut picture appears at the bottom). The outcome is shown above the board with a red and blue background according to your colors.<br>
If your scores are equal you get to repeat the choice.<br>
When the scores are different a message ("You start" or "Your friend starts") tells you who starts.<br><p>

Afterwards, playing is like <a href="#android">playing with Android</a>.<br><p>

When the game is over the dialog gives you an option to play another game.
If one of you choose so, the winner starts the game and gets to throw the yuts first.
