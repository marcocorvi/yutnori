<h3> Y U T   N O R I </h3>

Yut Nori is a traditinal korean game.<br>
Use "Back" button to quit Yut-Nori.<br><p>

There are two ways to play: 
<ol>
<li><a href="#android">you play against Android</a>.</li> 
<li><a href="#friend">you play against your friend</a>.</li>
</ol><p>

<h4>THE RULES OF YUT NORI</h4>

There are two players.<br>
Each player has four pawns (mal).<br>
The Yut Nori board has 29 stations.<br>
At the beginning all the pawns are on the START at the bottom left.<br>
You move the pawns on the board starting from the start station, indicated by the black L-arrow, and go around the board counterclockwise,
until they pass beyond the fourth corner and are placed in the HOME at the bottom right.<br>
If a pawns stops at a corner at the next move you can decide to move it through the shortcut diagonal.<br><p>

The game is won by the player who completes the board course with all the four pawns first.<br><p>

Therefore there are five routes to go through the board.<br><p>
<img src="routes.png">
<br><p>

To move the pawn the players throw the Yut Nori sticks (<i>yut</i>) in turn.<br>
They move the pawns (<i>mal</i>) by the score they get:<br>
<ul>
<li>one stick up (<i>do</i>): move by one step</li>
<li>two sticks up (<i>gae</i>): move by two steps</li>
<li>three sticks up (<i>geol</i>): move by three steps</li>
<li>four sticks up (<i>yut</i>): move by four steps</li>
<li>all sticks down (<i>mo</i>): move by five steps</li>
</ul>
<img src="scores.png">
<br><p>

When a player scores <i>yut</i> (4) or <i>mo</i> (5) he gets another throw.
Therefore there is no limit to the number of scores a player can get before he moves.
The scores can be played separatedly, each given to a pawn, but a score cannot be split among two pawns.<br><p>

If a pawn lands on a station occupied by the other players' pawns these are sent back to the START, and the player gets another throw of the sticks.<br><p>

If a pawn lands on a station occupied by another pawn of the same player, the pawns form a group and travel together from that point on.<br><p>


<h4>SPECIAL GAME RULES</h4>
The special rules are additional to the traditional Yut-Nori rules.<br>
One, two, or three sticks can have a <i>BACK</i> mark. When there is only one stick up with the <i>BACK</i> mark visible,
that is a <i>back-do</i> and the pawns move according to a special rule.<br><p>

By default the app starts playing the traditional Yut-Nori, with no stick with the <i>BACK</i> mark and no special rule.<br>
If you enabled the special rules through the proper setting, you can choose the rule before starting the game.<br>
The special rule, and the number of sticks with the <i>BACK</i> mark must be chosen before you start to play.<br>
<p>

<!-- b>Mal split</b>. In traditional Yut-Nori when there is more than one pawn at a station, you can decide how many to move.
You can choose wheather to play with the <i>split</i> rule, or to have to move the pawns from a station as a whole.<br>
To select how many pawns to move, after selecting the station with the pawns, tap it a second time and pick the number of pawns to move.
Next tap the station we want to move to.<br><p --> 

With the <b>Seoul</b> rule, a back-do moves a pawns directly from START to the <i>Seoul</i> station, the center of the board.
If there are no pawns at START, it is a normal <i>do</i> and the pawns move one step forward.<br><p>

With the <b>Busan</b> rule, a back-do moves a pawn from START to the <i>Busan</i> station, the corner opposite to the last station.
If there are no pawns at START, it is a normal <i>do</i> and the pawns move one step forward.<br><p>

With the <b>Back-Do</b> rule, pawns on the board move one step backward, with a back-do.
If the pawns are at the third or fourth corner, or at the center station, the player can choose to which station the pawns
move back.<br>  
There are four ways to play <i>Back-Do</i>. You choose which with
three checkboxes: <i>Skip Do</i>, <i>Do Spot</i>, <i>Do Cage</i>.
When no checkbox is checked the <i>normal</i> back-do is played.<br><p>

With the <b>Normal</b> Back-Do, a back-do moves the pawns one step backward.
Pawns in the first station (the Do-station) go to START. 
If there are no pawns on the board the <i>back-do</i> has the effect of a normal <i>do</i> and
a pawn is moved from START to the Do-station.<br><p>

<b>Skip Do</b> is like the <i>normal</i> Back-Do, but if the player has no pawns on the board he skips the turn.
<br><p>

In <b>Do spot</b> Back-Do, a <i>back-do</i> moves the pawns in the Do-station to the last station.
If the player has no pawn on the board a <i>back-do</i> is treated as a normal Do, and a pawn is moved from START to the Do-station.
<br><p>

In <b>Do cage</b> if the player has pawns on the board, he moves them from a station one step backward.
Pawns at the Do-station go to START.
If there are no pawns on the board, a pawn goes from START to the CAGE, underneat START.
A pawn in the CAGE stays there untin another back-Do is thrown; in this case it goes to the last station.
<br><p>


<a name="android"><h4>PLAYING WITH ANDROID</h4></a>
When you open Yut-Nori, a menu with 3 items appears.
You choose "Play against Android".
Android' pawns are RED.
Your pawns are BLUE, and you start first.<br><p>

When it is your turn to throw the sticks a yut picture appears at the bottom and "THROW" is displayed in the title. Tap on the yut picture to throw the sticks.
The outcome is shown above the board.<br><p>

After you have thrown the sticks, the title becomes "MOVE". To move a pawn (or a group of pawns) tap on the pawn you want to move (or on the pawns at to bottom left). They are highlighted with a blue background. Then tap on the station you want to move it to. To move it to the "home" station tap at the bottom right.<br><p>

When it is Android turn, the title becomes red and it shows "WAIT".<br><p>

When the game is over the title displays the winner and a dialog tells you who won.<br><p>

<b>Special rules</b><br>
To play a <i>Seoul</i> or a <i>Busan</i> move, tap the Yuts in the START.<br>
To skip your turn, tap the screen in the middle bottom.<br>
To move the pawn from the Do-station to the last station or to START, first tap the first station, then the destination.<br>
To move a pawn from START to the <i>Do Cage</i> tap START or the <i>Do Cage</i>.<br>
To move the pawn(s) from the <i>Do Cage</i> to the final station, tap the <i>Do Cage</i>.<br>
<p>

There are three different play engines for Android. 
The engine choice is one of the settings.<br><p>


<a name="friend"><h4>PLAYING WITH YOUR FRIEND</h4></a>

You and your friend must have your Androids paired on bluetooth.<br><p>

Open your Yut-Nori's.<br>
In the start dialog one of you chooses "Wait for a friend's Yut-Nori request" and waits.
The other chooses "Ask a friend to play together".<br>
When the list of paired devices appears, he selects the friend's device, and taps "Attach".
Android sends to the friend a message "<i>...</i> wants to play with you", where <i>...</i> is the name of the Android that asked the connection.<br>
The friend selects "Accept". Android sends messages to both of you "Connected to <i>...</i>. Let's decide who starts. Your color is RED/BLUE".
You both must select "OK".<br><p>

To decide who starts, you and your friend throw the yuts in turns (when the yut picture appears at the bottom).
The outcome is shown above the board with a red and blue background according to your colors.<br>
If your scores are equal you get to repeat the choice.<br>
When the scores are different a message ("You start" or "Your friend starts") tells who starts.<br><p>

Afterwards, playing is like <a href="#android">playing with Android</a>.<br><p>

When the game is over the dialog gives you an option to play another game.
If one of you choose so, the winner starts the game and gets to throw the yuts first.
