<h3> Y U T   N O R I </h3>

Yut Nori is a traditinal korean game.<br>
Use "Back" button to quit Yut-Nori.<br><p>

There are two ways to play: 
<ol>
<li><a href="#android">you play against Android</a>.</li> 
<li><a href="#friend">you play against your friend</a>.</li>
</ol><p>

<h4>THE RULES OF YUT NORI</h4>

There are two players.<br>
Each player has four pawns (mal).<br>
The Yut Nori board has 29 stations.<br>
At the beginning all the pawns are on the START at the bottom left.<br>
You move the pawns on the board starting from the start station, indicated by the black L-arrow, and go around the board counterclockwise,
until they pass beyond the fourth corner and are placed in the HOME at the bottom right.<br>
If a pawns stops at a corner at the next move you can decide to move it through the shortcut diagonal.<br><p>

The game is won by the player who completes the board course with all the four pawns first.<br><p>

Therefore there are five routes to go through the board.<br><p>
<img src="routes.png">
<br><p>

To move the pawn the players throw the Yut Nori sticks (<i>yut</i>) in turn.<br>
They move the pawns (<i>mal</i>) by the score they get:<br>
<ul>
<li>one stick up (<i>do</i>): move by one step</li>
<li>two sticks up (<i>gae</i>): move by two steps</li>
<li>three sticks up (<i>geol</i>): move by three steps</li>
<li>four sticks up (<i>yut</i>): move by four steps</li>
<li>all sticks down (<i>mo</i>): move by five steps</li>
</ul>
<img src="scores.png">
<br><p>

When a player scores <i>yut</i> (4) or <i>mo</i> (5) he gets another throw.
Therefore there is no limit to the number of scores a player can get before he moves.
The scores can be played separatedly, each given to a pawn, but a score cannot be split among two pawns.<br><p>

If a pawn lands on a station occupied by the other players' pawns these are sent back to the START, and the player gets another throw of the sticks.<br><p>

If a pawn lands on a station occupied by another pawn of the same player, the pawns form a group and travel together from that point on.<br><p>


<h4>SPECIAL GAME RULES</h4>
These rules are chosen before you start a game and let you customize the play.<br>
By default the app starts playing a plain Yut-Nori, with no special rules.<br>
<p>

<b>Mal split</b>. In traditional Yut-Nori when there is more than one pawn at a station, you can decide how many to move.
You can choose wheather to play with the <i>split</i> rule, or to have to move the pawns from a station as a whole.<br>
To select how many pawns to move, after selecting the station with the pawns, tap it a second time and pick the number of pawns to move.
Next tap the station we want to move to.<br><p> 


<b>Back-Do</b>. This is a special rule added to the traditional Yut-Nori rule.<br>
One, two, or three sticks have a <i>BACK</i> mark. When there is only one stick up, it is a <i>back do</i>.<br>
There are five different ways to play <i>back-do</i>. You choose which way to play by checking among four checkboxes.
When none is checked the normal back-do is played.<br><p>

In the <b>Normal</b> play, a back-do moves the pawns from a station one step backward.
If the player has pawns in the first station, they are moved to START. Otherwise the <i>back-do</i> has the effect of a normal <i>do</i>.<br><p>

In the <b>Seoul</b> play, a back-do moves a pawns directly from the START to the <i>Seoul</i> station, the center of the board.
If there are no pawns at the START, it is a normal <i>do</i>.<br><p>

In the <b>Busan</b> play, a back-do moves a pawn from the START to the <i>Busan</i> station, the corner opposite to the last station.
If there are no pawns at the START, it is a normal <i>do</i>.<br><p>

There are two variants to the normal <i>back-do</i> for the the case the player has no pawn on the board that can be moved backward:
<ul>
<li><b>Skip Do</b>. If the player has pawns at the first stations, they are moves to START. Otherwise the player skips the next turn.</li>
<li><b>Do spot</b>.  If the player has pawns in the <i>Do Spot</i> a <i>back-do</i> moves them to the last station.
If there is no pawn in the <i>Do Spot</i>, the pawns at the first station are moved to the <i>Do Spot</i>, or, if the first station is empty, a pawn from START is moved to the <i>Do Spot</i>.
If the player has neither pawns at the first station not at START, nothing is done, and the <i>back-do</i> is ignored.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>


<a name="android"><h4>PLAYING WITH ANDROID</h4></a>
When you open Yut-Nori, a menu with 3 items appears.
You choose "Play against Android".
Android' pawns are RED.
Your pawns are BLUE, and you start first.<br><p>

When it is your turn to throw the sticks a yut picture appears at the bottom and "THROW" is displayed in the title. Tap on the yut picture to throw the sticks.
The outcome is shown above the board.<br><p>

After you have thrown the sticks, the title becomes "MOVE". To move a pawn (or a group of pawns) tap on the pawn you want to move (or on the pawns at to bottom left). They are highlighted with a blue background. Then tap on the station you want to move it to. To move it to the "home" station tap at the bottom right.<br><p>

When it is Android turn, the title becomes red and it shows "WAIT".<br><p>

When the game is over the title displays the winner and a dialog tells you who won.<br><p>

<b>Special rules</b><br>
To play a <i>Seoul</i> or a <i>Busan</i>, tap the Yuts in the START.<br>
To play a <i>skip</i> or skip your turn, tap the Yuts in the middle bottom.<br>
To move a pawn from START to the <i>Do Spot</i> tap the <i>Do Spot</i>.<br>
To move the pawn from the first station to the <i>Do Spot</i> or to START, first tap the first station, then the destination.<br>
To move the pawn(s) from the <i>Do Spot</i> to the final station, tap the <i>Do Spot</i>.<br>
<p>

There are three different play engines for Android. 
The engine choice is one of the settings.<br><p>


<a name="friend"><h4>PLAYING WITH YOUR FRIEND</h4></a>

You and your friend must have your Androids paired on bluetooth.<br><p>

Open your Yut-Nori's.<br>
In the start dialog one of you chooses "Wait for a friend's Yut-Nori request" and waits.
The other chooses "Ask a friend to play together".<br>
When the list of paired devices appears, he selects the friend's device, and taps "Attach".
Android sends to the friend a message "<i>...</i> wants to play with you", where <i>...</i> is the name of the Android that asked the connection.<br>
The friend selects "Accept". Android sends messages to both of you "Connected to <i>...</i>. Let's decide who starts. Your color is RED/BLUE".
You both must select "OK".<br><p>

To decide who starts, you and your friend throw the yuts in turns (when the yut picture appears at the bottom).
The outcome is shown above the board with a red and blue background according to your colors.<br>
If your scores are equal you get to repeat the choice.<br>
When the scores are different a message ("You start" or "Your friend starts") tells who starts.<br><p>

Afterwards, playing is like <a href="#android">playing with Android</a>.<br><p>

When the game is over the dialog gives you an option to play another game.
If one of you choose so, the winner starts the game and gets to throw the yuts first.
