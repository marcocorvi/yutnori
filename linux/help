Y U T   N O R I

Yut Nori is a traditinal korean game. 
This is an abridged version of the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
THE RULES OF YUT NORI

There are two players: you play against the computer.
Each player has four pawns (mal); yours are red the computer are green.
The Yut Nori board has 29 stations.
At the beginning all the pawns are in the cells at the bottom right.
You move the pawns on the board starting from the start station, 
indicated by the arrow, and go around the board until they pass
beyond the fourth corner (and are placed in the "home" cells at the
bottom left). If a pawns stops at a corner at the next move you can 
decide to move it through the shortcut diagonal.

Therefore there are four routes to go through the board:
  o - - - - o    o - - - - o   o . . . . o   o . . . . o
  | .     . |    . \     . |   . .     / |   . .     / |
  |   . .   |    .   \ .   |   .   . /   |   .   . /   |
  |   . .   |    .   . \   |   .   / .   |   .   . \   |
  | .     . |    . .     \ |   . /     . |   . .     \ |
  o - - - - +    o . . . . +   o - - - - +   o . . . . +

To move the pawn the players throw the Yut Nori sticks in turn.
They move the pawns my the score they get:
  - one stick up (do): move by one step
  - two sticks up (gae): move by two steps
  - three sticks up (geol): move by three steps
  - four sticks up (yut): move by four steps
  - all sticks down (mo): move by five steps
When a player scores "yut" (4) or "mo" (5) he gets another throw.
Therefore there is no limit to the number of scores a player can
get before he moves. The scores can be played separatedly, each given
to a pawn, but a score cannot be split among two pawns. 

If a pawn lands on a station occupied by the other players' pawns
these are sent back to the initial cell, and the player gets another
throw of the sticks. 

If a pawn lands on a station occupied by another pawn of the same
player, the pawns form a group and travel together from that point on.
[Note: in the traditional Yut Nori the player can decide whether to
form a group or not]

The game is won by the player who completes the board course with all
the four pawns first.

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

When it is your turn to throw the sticks the second menu button
displays "Throw": to throw click on the button. The score is shown
between the menus and the board.

When you can move a pawn (or a group of pawns) the menu button
displays "Move". To move click first on the station with the pawn
you want to move (or on the stating cell), and then click again
on the station where you want to move the pawn to (or to the stating
cell if the pawn completes the course).

When the computer plays, the menu button displays "Wait".
